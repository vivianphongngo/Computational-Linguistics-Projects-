If one wants a relation where he/she wants to be always in the good books of another person, he/she pretends to behave friendly and says and do things favorable to the other person. If, otherwise, he/she takes care of the other friend, he has to be himself and also correct the other person when he/she is wrong. Truth is bitter. Let us try to explain with an example. say, our friend smokes. Everybody knows smoking is injurious to the health. If you are a person who just wants to be in the good books, you will appreciate his habits. You may comment on the smoker’s style of smoking. You may say, how smoking a cigarette reflects his attitude, like he looks cool, he looks manly and his style is good. You may dislike the smell, but you just be in that place, just because you don’t want to hurt him. By this, you actually don’t care for the person. Whereas, otherwise, you seriously care for the person. You will say that the behavior is bad and you will try to make him understand how smoking will actually affect him and you.

Firs of all, the trust is going to keep a relation going on with confidence and confidence is something really important and you’re going to trust in a person only once. If you lose the trust in someone I think that you will never more be able to trust in this person again. Will you trust a very important value to someone that has already stolen you? I bet you won’t. Second, nobody like to be seen as a fool. It’s not nice been as a glown. It’s not a good sensation to be kept in lies while there many people who know the truth. Can you imagine the sensation of been betrayed? How can you look at someone’s face that betrayed you? A relationship, in this way, won’t be nice and trustful. Once I saw that for a relationship be solid you must trust in person at the point of let yourself fell back in the person arms. I mean, you trust that the person is going to be on your back to hold you on. It won’t be possible with a person that lies to you. The truth means that you can’t lie and if you can’t lie you won’t be able to betray, once you won’t be able to hide anything. If you can’t betray you’re going to have a perfect relationship. The truth is really the basis of a relationship. As a conclusion, I think that the truth is really important in a relationship because it gives you some safety in this relationship, the sensation that you won’t be betrayed.\"\"\"\n",

Furthermore, we could learn from old collegue that to keep the business secrete is to keep the position.\n",

If the answer is No (truth for sure). We could imagine the accompanied results. This is why we are using the term white lie to find the suitable reason to use minor lies.\n",

        "This is a good example of how bad lying is. In the way to make a good relation, people should tell the true whether it may not good in some situation, but everything can be better if people learn when they should say it in the proper time. From my experiences, I used to lost my trust because I did not tell the true. When I was young, I wanted many toys , but I did not have money. I stole people money and lied about where I got the money. One day, everyone found that I stole money and lied to everyone. No one believed me any more. After I grow up and learn that lying is not good, so I always try to tell the true. It made me feel a lot better than before. However, telling the true can make prople sometimes if people don’t learn about when they should say. For example, telling the true to women can make them lose their comfident and put men in trouble sometimes. In the conclusion, I agree that people should alway tell the true to make a good relationship ;however, I think the most important about telling the true is time. If people tell the true in the wrong time, they can be in trouble anyway. The key is tell the true in the appropiate time.\"\"\"\n",

For me the total truth is allways the best way to solve a problem, if there is a solution. By having all the elements a person can have all idea of what to do. For example, if some one is on a trial you have to tell you layer all the information in order to win or at list the fight well, if not the person can will come with diferent stores by excluding information. Now telling a partial truth you are triyng to help the people without hurting them, for example, when a friend ask us if she is fat, and she actially weigths 90 kilos, you wont answer, yes you are as fat as a cow, bewcause you will break her fillings, so you just need to be sutil and friendle, and responder her that, it isnt something that it cannot be fixed, and you can probablie offer her help.

        "Firstly, I would like to support the view that learning from other people is important. That happens because when you only learn from your parents you only get to see a unique point of view, making it the only one you see. The issue of that is when diversity is overlooked it happens to open space to a more narrowed and intolerant view of the world.

Embedding positive traits on their kids, such as discipline, respect for others, positivity and honesty, is really the best a kid can hope for. Still, there are those who learn things from their parents that would be best forgotten, like greed, racism, and falsehood.\n",

That happens because when you only learn from your parents you only get to see a unique point of view, making it the only one you see. The issue of that is when diversity is overlooked it happens to open space to a more narrowed and intolerant view of the world. Personally, I dealt with people who were really close to their parents and they usually didn’t know how to make points or even think for themselves.\n",

        "Nonetheless, for good or bad, our parents are the single most influential people in our pre-adult lives. They have the ability to shape and model our personality and our views of the world. Like the saying goes, an apple does not fall far from the tree. In my experience, most parents have had a positive influence on their kids and were therefore the best teachers. Embedding positive traits on their kids, such as discipline, respect for others, positivity and honesty, is really the best a kid can hope for. Still, there are those who learn things from their parents that would be best forgotten, like greed, racism, and falsehood.\n",

        "In conclusion, the effectiveness of parental teaching is a two way ticket. They can teach a lot of good things to their kids(like honesty and discipline) and can teach bad things(such as racism). This happens because of the strong influence from parents on kids needing a third party to influence the kid to don’t be a copy of the parents view of the world(like thinking for themselves). Thus showing the ambiguous view that parents are effective teachers but not the best.\"\"\".count(' a ')\n",

Parents, family and close friends can all help in our decision making but it is ultimately up to the person to make the final decision. But not all important decisions are the same. There are decisions that we make as young adults that affect others. Some decisions we make do not impact other people. This essay will defend that each situation is different and must be analyzed carefully.\n",

        "If you want to do an important decision obviously you can, but the decision cannot affect other people. For example of these decisions, if you want to change your university, you don't need ask for other people because you study by yourself. Another example, if you want to travel around the world, you don't need ask others.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are decisions that you should consult others as they affect others. If someone has a wife, she needs to participate in every important decision. It would be irresponsible to decide to leave a job and take another one without discussing the matter with your wife because she is also impacted by your decision. Likewise, if someone has a kid, he or she must consult with the partner before committing to a decision. It would also be irresponsible to decide by yourself where the kid will study. In situations where others are involved and impacted, a person should never make an important decision alone.\n",
        "\n",
        "As we have seen, during life we need to make many important decisions. These decisions can affect other people or not and we talked about them. If you make a decision, you can´t affect other people. For example, travel around the world or change your university. But some decisions we need to ask other people. If you have a partner or a kid, you can´t make a decision alone because it will affect others. So it depends if it will affect others or not.\"\"\".count(' a ')\n",
